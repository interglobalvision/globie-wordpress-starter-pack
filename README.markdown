---------------

This is a very basic Wordpress theme that is basically a stripdown of the famous [HTML5 boilerplate](http://http://html5boilerplate.com/)

I made it as a tool for my work. It is a starting point for developing custom WP themes and not a standalone theme. Unlike the HTML5 Boilerplace Wordpress Theme project it doesn't look like a proper theme on first install. It is very blank and thats the point.

If you find it useful for your own Wordpress development then great, and if you want to help improve this [as I'm sure it could be massively improved] then join in here.
